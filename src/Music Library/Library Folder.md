This is where, within the file system, your music will be stored and organized.

You don't need to manually organize your files here, as with this setup, [[Library Setup#MusicBee]] will scan files from the [[Inbox Folder]] and automatically sort it here.

> [!IMPORTANT]+
> The folder must already exist. If it doesn't yet, create it before proceeding with the next instructions.

To set this up:

1. Navigate to the `music library` settings
    1. Press `ctrl+o` on the keyboard to open the `preferences` dialog
    2. In the sidebar, click `library`
2. Enable `auto-organize media files`
3. Configure the library folder
    1. Click `organization...`
    2. In the `on drive:` field, select the drive your [[Inbox Folder]] is located
    3. In the `to folder:` field, select the folder you wish to be your library
    4. Click `save`

To have this library automatically synced to another device, see [[Sync Setup]].
